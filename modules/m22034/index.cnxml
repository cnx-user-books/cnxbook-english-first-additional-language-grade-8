      <para id="id7597225">ACTIVITY 1:</para>
      <para id="id3795470">This is all about an entrepreneur. Have a class discussion about finances in a country and how being an entrepreneur can help a family. See how many novel ideas they can come up with e.g. making rosettes for horse and swimming galas; transforming a yard and garage into a place for holding birthday parties.</para>
      <para id="id1171521146521">ACTIVITY 2:</para>
      <para id="id1171531201703">Go through each item carefully and then see how many novel ideas the class can put together. Let them share their ideas with the class. A prize for the most innovative and resourceful? (Here is a good time to study words like â€˜resourcefulâ€™, â€˜innovativeâ€™, â€˜responsibleâ€™, re-cyclingâ€™ etc â€“ entrepreneurial words).</para>
      <para id="id1171526105795">ACTIVITY 3:</para>
      <para id="id1171525881953">Go through the fur business basics and see how accurately they answer. Check for spelling and language errors. Explain that if a space is small, that errors stand out more!</para>
      <para id="id5853889">ACTIVITY 4:</para>
      <para id="id1171520280145">Now let them do the next ACTIVITY really well as a project. Give them reasonable time but explain that this is the ROUGH DRAFT which also needs to be handed in to see how involved they were and how much preparation went into the project.</para>
      <para id="id1171528318989">ACTIVITY 5:</para>
      <para id="id1085298">The final copy of the front page must show signs of editing and thoroughness. Put the best ideas on the board and discuss them as a class. Make sue they have done all that was asked of them. Explain the value of following instructions clearly and well.</para>
      <para id="id1171529294284"><emphasis effect="bold">FEATURES OF VENTURE</emphasis>: The summary must be just that â€“ a brief, clear, correct synopsis.</para>
      <para id="id8890006"><emphasis effect="bold">MARKETING PLAN</emphasis>: These can be placed in the classroom for peer judgement. The really good should be framed (laminated or glass-framed)! Go over the evaluation chart with them first before they start.</para>
      <para id="id4262626"><emphasis effect="bold">FINANCIAL PLAN</emphasis>: Look at all the possibilities of ways to raise money as a class. Make a list. Explain about the different graphs to use to explain information.</para>
